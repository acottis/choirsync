                    <h1>Instructions</h1>
                    <p>You can practice without recording on the left. When you’re ready to record, use the buttons on the right. The record button will turn red to show you're recording.</p>
                    <p>This works best if you use a computer. If you need to though, you can use a tablet or phone.</p>
                    <p>Please use head/earphones so that the recording will only pick up your voice and not the backing track playing out of speakers. I’d recommend doing a quick test recording first to check you don’t have any problems with your setup. See below if you do have issues.</p>
                    <p>Your recordings will show up on the right. You can do as many takes as you like, listen back to them, and then send on your favourite. I’ll only be able to see the one(s) you choose to send on.</p>
                    <p>You can record along to any track you like, whether that’s your own part, another part, or a track with all parts.</p>
                    <p>If something's not working, try using a different browser (e.g. Chrome, Edge) or updating your browser to the latest version.</p>
                    <p>Thanks!</p>

                    <h2>How to make sure you get a good recording</h2>
                    <p>If you can’t hear your voice very clearly:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try different head/earphones</li>
                        <li>Check where your microphone is and make sure you’re singing close to it</li>
                        <li>If you’re recording on a computer, you might have more than one microphone you can choose between.</li>
                        <ul class="sublist">
                            <li>Laptop microphones are usually at the top next to the camera</li>
                            <li>Head/earphones that have a volume control or a little block on the wire often have a microphone there too</li>
                            <li>Built-in phone/tablet microphones are often on the bottom near the charging socket</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>If you’re not sure which microphone you're using or where your microphone is, try making a recording where you tap each place you think the mic might be, narrating as you go. When you listen back to it you should hear something like ‘Here’s the earphone volume controls <i class="mini">tap tap tap</i> and this is the top of the keyboard <i class="mini">tap tap tap</i> and this is next to the camera <b>TAP! TAP! TAP!</b>’</li>
                        <li>On a computer if you have more than one microphone you should be able to change between them in the computer settings. Here's how to do this for <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-set-up-and-test-microphones-in-windows-10-ba9a4aab-35d1-12ee-5835-cccac7ee87a4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows</a> and for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2567/mac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mac</a>. (The links will open in a new tab so your recordings are safe.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you’ve got too much background noise:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try different head/earphones</li>
                        <li>Move to a quiet room if you can</li>
                        <li>Small rooms with carpets, curtains and lots of soft furnishings are best</li>
                        <li>Professionals recording at home sometimes even sit under a duvet or in a cupboard full of clothes!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you’re hearing the backing track as well as your voice:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try different head/earphones</li>
                        <li>Check you’ve not got the microphone too close to the speakers in your head/earphones (see above if you’re not sure where the mic is)</li>
                        <li>Turn down your computer/tablet/phone's volume</li>
                    </ul>
